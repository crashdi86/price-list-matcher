<p><strong>Comprehensive Security & Storage Solutions that Protect Email</strong></p>
<p>Todays IT professionals need an easy-to-manage and comprehensive email security
and compliance solution. Barracuda Essentials for Email Security provides cloudbased advanced targeted attack Protection, email continuity, encryption and data
leakage Protection, and archiving at an affordable price  no additional hardware
or software required.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Email Threat Protection</h3>
<p>Todays IT professionals need an easy to manage email security solution that Protects against phishing, malware, and ransomware. Along with multi-layer email security, the Barracuda Email Security Service provides email continuity and data leakage prevention.</p>
<p>Advanced Threat Detection (ATD) combines behavioral, heuristic, and sandboxing technologies to Protect against zero hour, targeted attacks and ransomware variants including Locky and CryptoLocker. ATD automatically scans email attachments in realtime; suspicious attachments are detonated in a sandbox environment to observe behavior. Link Protection redirects suspicious and typo-squatted URLs so malware is never inadvertently downloaded by recipients.</p>
<h3>Archiving for Compliance</h3>
<p>Barracuda Cloud Email Archiving Service integrates with Exchange and cloud-based email services like Google Apps to create a cloud based, indexed archive. It allows granular retention policies, extensive search, auditing/permissions, legal hold, and export helping to facilitate eDiscovery and retention.</p>
<p>Litigation holds preserve email from being tampered with until the litigation hold expires or is removed. Native and mobile apps provide intuitive interfaces that simplify search to ensure messages are found easily, even when email services are unavailable.</p>
<h3>Business Continuity</h3>
<p>Barracuda Email Security ensures that email can still be delivered even during email server failures or loss of connectivity. In the event of email server disruptions, email can be spooled in the Cloud Protection Layer for up to 96 hours. If delivery to the primary destination fails, an alternate destination can be specified for delivery.</p>
<p>During email server outages, the email for all mail servers is visible through the Cloud Protection Layer. From the message log, you can see the status of all spooled emails, and whether mail has been redelivered.</p>","<ul style=""list-style-type:disc"">

<h3>Barracuda Networks and Microsoft Azure</h3>
<p>Barracuda Networks was the first Microsoft Azure Certified Security Solution Provider. The Microsoft Azure Certification assures that the Barracuda Solutions have been tested for readiness and compatibility with Microsoft Azure public cloud, Microsoft Cloud Platform hosted by service providers through the Cloud OS Network, and on-premises private cloud Windows Server Hyper-V deployments.</p>
<p><strong>The Microsoft Azure Certification brings customers several benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Time of deployment is cut by 50-80%</li>
<li>Ease of deployment increased by 90%</li>
<li>Deployment bandwidth requirements are reduced to near-zero</li>
<li>Current and future Barracuda on Microsoft Azure products allow both evaluation and purchased licenses at deployment time</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft works closely with Barracuda engineering, solutions architects and sales teams to create a great customer experience and make it easy for customers to leverage the Barracuda NextGen Control Center, Barracuda Spam Firewall and Barracuda Web Application Firewall to move their applications into the Azure cloud securely.</p>
<p>The Barracuda Spam Firewall and Barracuda Message Archiver offer best-of-breed email management, archiving, and security for organizations utilizing Microsoft Office 365. And there is more to come &ndash; stay tuned and learn about the latest innovations from Barracuda Networks and Microsoft Azure.</p>
<h3>Moving Your Physical Data Center to the Cloud?</h3>
<p>Get Secure Connectivity with Visibility and Control with the industry's most advanced next-generation firewall solution for Microsoft Azure. The Barracuda NextGen Control Center ensures highly secure, encrypted traffic from, to, and within Microsoft Azure, providing secure remote and site-to-site access, and centralized management.</p>
<p>The growth in cloud computing capabilities and services has driven more data into places where traditional IT security measures cannot reach - into data centers not owned by your corporate IT group. The Barracuda NextGen Control Center provides centralized management and highly secure, encrypted traffic to, from, and within Microsoft Azure deployments. Securing applications and data in Microsoft Azure is far easier with tools that are dedicated to the task. Deploying the Barracuda NextGen Control Center in the cloud is very similar to running local network firewalls, and provides the advantages of common policy enforcement and distributed security management in a hybrid-IT environment. It provides next-generation firewalling and secure remote access to Microsoft Azure. It enables organizations to deploy sophisticated multi-zone network architecture in Microsoft Azure, just like their on-premises networks.</p>
<p>By using the proprietary high-performance VPN protocol extension TINA, the Barracuda NextGen Control Center deployment enables secure high-speed site-to-site and client-to-site connectivity between on-premises networks and mobile-user devices, as well as connectivity between VNETs in Microsoft Azure. Best of all, it features the industry's best centralized management, ensuring highly scalable and fault tolerant network infrastructure required by today&rsquo;s users, without the management overhead. The Barracuda NextGen Control Center adds a powerful and intuitive centralized management portal that makes it extremely simple to deploy, configure, update, and manage multiple units from a single location, while also providing comprehensive, real-time network visibility and reporting.</p>

<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence for Real-Time Email Protection</strong></p>
<p>Business email compromise (BEC), spear phishing, and account takeover are rapidly becoming the most significant security threats facing organizations. These hyper-targeted attacks use socially engineered tactics designed to deceive employees and can be devastating to your business and brand.</p>
<p>Sentinel combines artificial intelligence, deep integration with Microsoft Office 365, and brand protection into a comprehensive cloud-based solution that guards against business email compromise, account takeover, spear phishing and other cyber fraud.</p>
<h3>Real-Time Defense Against Business Email Compromise</h3>
<p>At the heart of Barracuda Sentinel is the AI engine that detects and blocks socially engineered attacks in real-time and identifies the employees who are at highest risk. Unique API-based architecture gives Sentinel’s AI engine access to historical email data to learn each user’s unique communications patterns. The engine leverages multiple classifiers to map the social networks of every individual inside the company and identifies anomalous signals in message metadata and content.<p>
<p>Sentinel’s unique approach does not rely on static rules to detect targeted attacks— it relies on historical statistics of each organization to determine with a higher degree of accuracy whether a certain email is part of a socially engineered attack or account takeover.</p>
<h3>Protection Against Account Takeover & Insider Risk</h3>
<p>Every day, legitimate business accounts get compromised due to stolen credentials. The account takeover can remain dormant in your environment for months, with hackers watching and learning before launching their attacks. Any internal attacks launched from a compromised account often don’t pass through gateway and therefore go undetected.</p>
<p>Barracuda Sentinel’s comprehensive solution to account takeover includes three components: prevention, detection, and remediation. Barracuda Sentinel prevents targeted phishing attacks that bypass traditional email gateways and can lead to harvesting credentials. If an account has been compromised, Barracuda Sentinel detects the anomalous behavior and alerts IT. Finally, Barracuda Sentinel can remediate the attack by removing all of the malicious emails sent by the compromised account from within employee mailboxes with one click.</p>
<h3>Brand Protection & Domain Fraud Visibility</h3>

Link Protection redirects suspicious and typo-squatted URLs so malware is never inadvertently downloaded by recipients.</p>
<h3>Archiving for Compliance</h3>
<p>Barracuda Cloud Email Archiving Service integrates with Exchange and cloud-based email services like Google Apps to create a cloud based, indexed archive. It allows granular retention policies, extensive search, auditing/permissions, legal hold, and export helping to facilitate eDiscovery and retention.</p>
<p>Litigation holds preserve email from being tampered with until the litigation hold expires or is removed. Native and mobile apps provide intuitive interfaces that simplify search to ensure messages are found easily, even when email services are unavailable.</p>
<h3>Business Continuity</h3>
<p>Barracuda Email Security ensures that email can still be delivered even during email server failures or loss of connectivity. In the event of email server disruptions, email can be spooled in the Cloud Protection Layer for up to 96 hours. If delivery to the primary destination fails, an alternate destination can be specified for delivery.</p>
<p>During email server outages, the email for all mail servers is visible through the Cloud Protection Layer. From the message log, you can see the status of all spooled emails, and whether mail has been redelivered.</p>","<ul style=""list-style-type:disc"">

<p>We also understand that sometimes equipment can fail. We therefore offer the Barracuda Instant Replacement service. With the Instant Replacement service, we provide next business day shipping of replacement hardware.</p>

<p>If your Barracuda Networks product fails, we will ship you a replacement unit within 1 business day so you can get back up and running soon. Replacement requests received outside normal business hours will be considered received the next business day for purposes of shipping date. Actual delivery time will vary based on transit time.</p>

<h3>Hardware Refresh</h3><p>
Along with providing priority replacements in case of equipment failure, the Instant Replacement service also provides ongoing migration to the latest hardware platforms through the Barracuda Hardware Refresh Program.</p>

<p>Normally, refresh units are purchased for a fee that represents a discount over the list price over a new hardware unit. However, Barracuda Networks will waive this fee if your old hardware unit is more than 4 years old and covered under an Instant Replacement subscription. This means that by maintaining an Instant Replacement subscription with your Barracuda appliance, you can continue receiving a new hardware unit every 4 years at absolutely no additional cost.</p>

<p>With this, the Instant Replacement program provides a single, convenient subscription that covers you in case of hardware failure and provides an affordable way to migrate to the most current hardware platform on an ongoing basis.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Instant Replacement</h3>
<p>Enhanced Support which provides phone and email support 24x7.
Data migration service for Barracuda Email Security Gateways. Barracuda Networks will assist customers with moving the product configuration from the old product to the new product if the old configuration data is accessible.</p>

<p>If your Barracuda Networks product fails, we will ship you a replacement unit within 1 business day so you can get back up and running soon. Replacement requests received outside normal business hours will be considered received the next business day for purposes of shipping date. Actual delivery time will vary based on transit time.</p>

<h3>Hardware Refresh</h3><p>
Along with providing priority replacements in case of equipment failure, the Instant Replacement service also provides ongoing migration to the latest hardware platforms through the Barracuda Hardware Refresh Program.</p>

<p>Normally, refresh units are purchased for a fee that represents a discount over the list price over a new hardware unit. However, Barracuda Networks will waive this fee if your old hardware unit is more than 4 years old and covered under an Instant Replacement subscription. This means that by maintaining an Instant Replacement subscription with your Barracuda appliance, you can continue receiving a new hardware unit every 4 years at absolutely no additional cost.</p>

<p>With this, the Instant Replacement program provides a single, convenient subscription that covers you in case of hardware failure and provides an affordable way to migrate to the most current hardware platform on an ongoing basis.</p>

<p>If your Barracuda Networks product fails, we will ship you a replacement unit within 1 business day so you can get back up and running soon.

<h3>Hardware Refresh</h3><p>
Along with providing priority replacements in case of equipment failure, the Instant Replacement service also provides ongoing migration to the latest hardware platforms through the Barracuda Hardware Refresh Program.</p>

<p>Normally, refresh units are purchased for a fee that represents a discount over the list price over a new hardware unit. However, Barracuda Networks will waive this fee if your old hardware unit is more than 4 years old and covered under an Instant Replacement subscription. This means that by maintaining an Instant Replacement subscription with your Barracuda appliance, you can continue receiving a new hardware unit every 4 years at absolutely no additional cost.</p>

<p>With this, the Instant Replacement program provides a single, convenient subscription that covers you in case of hardware failure and provides an affordable way to migrate to the most current hardware platform on an ongoing basis.</p>

<h3>Cloud for Volumetric Defense</h3>
<p>Can your network handle hundreds of gigabits per second? Volumetric attacks are sufficiently large enough to overflow most organizations inbound capacity. To defend against these attacks, incoming traffic is first re-routed through Barracuda&rsquo;s high-bandwidth data centers that scrub the traffic clean before returning it to Barracuda WAF or WAF-as-a-Service.</p>
<h3>WAF for Layer 7 Defense</h3>
<p>Sneaky application layer level DDoS attacks such as Slowloris can slow down apps for everyone. HTTP floods or heavy URL resource attacks, including complex database queries, can quickly overwhelm applications. Technologies built into the Barracuda Web Application Firewall and WAF-as-a-Service mitigate the numerous application-layer and bot driven DDoS attacks.</p>","<ul style='list-style-type:disc'>

Protect websites, mobile applications and API’s from the growing threat of advanced bots that can scrape your data, lock up your inventory, skew your web analytics, bringing chaos for your digital business.</p>

<h3>Detect and block hidden almost-human bot attacks with machine learning.</h3>
<p>Our cloud-based Threat Intelligence Service uses crowd-sourced data and battle-tested machine learning models to identify and block sneaky low-and-slow attacks attempted by advanced bots.</p>

<h3>Improve user experience and security.</h3>
<p>Minimize the risk of data breaches, reputational damage and financial disasters without using CAPTCHAs or slowing down customers. Barracuda’s powerful, innovative application security and bot mitigation solutions are truly simple to deploy, configure, and manage.</p>


<h2>Features</h2>
<h4>Web & Price Scraping Protection</h4>
Competitors and other third parties often use automated scripts to steal pricing and other content in real-time. Price scraping and content scraping results in reduced customer visits and conversions. The ABP solution uses a number of signals – page access speeds, page access patterns, client telemetry (IP, SSL Fingerprint) etc – to identify and block possible web scraping attempts.

<h4>Brute Force Detection</h4>
<p>Brute Force attacks are typically used during reconnaissance attempts – these include attacks like directory traversal, credential cracking etc. The Barracuda WAF product line can identify brute force attempts from individual clients and block them.</p>


<h4>Bot Spam Detection</h4>
<p>Bot Spam takes various forms – it can be in the form of referrer spam, polluting your website analytics. Alternatively, it can present as Form Spam, with thousands of spurious signups on your internet facing forms. Either way, you end up with skewed data that can take forever to clean up. Barracuda ABP uses several methods to identify and block such spam, including learning all the forms on a website and the time taken to fill the form. It then uses these learned parameters to identify spammers and block them.</p>


<h4>Client Fingerprinting</h4>
<p>Blocking an entire IP address for bad behavior causes significant problems. This method can be used for known problem IP ranges, such as hosting providers, TOR ranges etc, but in most cases, an IP address may have hundreds or more users behind it. The Barracuda ABP systems uses passive and active methods to fingerprint each client beyond the IP, down to the browser level. This allows you to block a single misbehaving client down to the browser level, reducing the blast radius of the block.</p>
<h4>Protective Defence</h4>
<p>Bots come from a variety of sources – home IP addresses, datacenters, VPS, consumer VPN providers and Tor. In some cases, it is quite easy to stop bots by blocking entire IP ranges, like VPS providers or datacenters. The Barracuda WAF product line provides several such IP categories, including reputation-based lists to proactively block attackers and bots at the IP level.</p>

<h4>Account Takeover Detection</h4>
<p>Credential Stuffing and Spraying attacks have been used to compromise household names the world over with Account Takeover attacks. Attackers use bots and breached credential lists to perform low and slow brute force attacks and takeover user accounts. Barracuda ABP hosts a cloud database of breached credentials and validated incoming logins against this database. When a hit is found, you can then block the attacker and secure the user account.</p>

<h4>Machine Learnign Based Bot Detection</h4>
<p>Today’s bots are built to be almost human in their behavior. Standard signature checks and validations do not always catch these bots. Barracuda ABP’s cloud-based detection identifies the most advanced bots within the first few requests using a combination of website specific rules and machine learning models. The website specific rules are built by our system for each application you onboard, leading to a very low false positive rate. Since the ML system is built in the cloud, new bot detection models that are deployed are usable by all connected systems without needing a firmware upgrade.</p>

<h4>Crowd-Sourced Bot Detection</h4>
<p>The Barracuda ABP systems gets data from a massive honeypot network which collects many forms of threat intelligence beyond web attacks. This intelligence is combined with other data we see in production systems the world over, and a curated crowd-sourced threat intelligence stream is available to every ABP customer.</p>","<ul style=""list-style-type:disc"">

<h2>Features</h2>
<h4>Web & Price Scraping Protection</h4>
Competitors and other third parties often use automated scripts to steal pricing and other content in real-time. Price scraping and content scraping results in reduced customer visits and conversions. The ABP solution uses a number of signals – page access speeds, page access patterns, client telemetry (IP, SSL Fingerprint) etc – to identify and block possible web scraping attempts.

<h4>Brute Force Detection</h4>
<p>Brute Force attacks are typically used during reconnaissance attempts – these include attacks like directory traversal, credential cracking etc. The Barracuda WAF product line can identify brute force attempts from individual clients and block them.</p>


<h4>Bot Spam Detection</h4>
<p>Bot Spam takes various forms – it can be in the form of referrer spam, polluting your website analytics. Alternatively, it can present as Form Spam, with thousands of spurious signups on your internet facing forms. Either way, you end up with skewed data that can take forever to clean up. Barracuda ABP uses several methods to identify and block such spam, including learning all the forms on a website and the time taken to fill the form. It then uses these learned parameters to identify spammers and block them.</p>


<h4>Client Fingerprinting</h4>
<p>Blocking an entire IP address for bad behavior causes significant problems. This method can be used for known problem IP ranges, such as hosting providers, TOR ranges etc, but in most cases, an IP address may have hundreds or more users behind it. The Barracuda ABP systems uses passive and active methods to fingerprint each client beyond the IP, down to the browser level. This allows you to block a single misbehaving client down to the browser level, reducing the blast radius of the block.</p>
<h4>Protective Defence</h4>
<p>Bots come from a variety of sources – home IP addresses, datacenters, VPS, consumer VPN providers and Tor. In some cases, it is quite easy to stop bots by blocking entire IP ranges, like VPS providers or datacenters. The Barracuda WAF product line provides several such IP categories, including reputation-based lists to proactively block attackers and bots at the IP level.</p>

<h4>Account Takeover Detection</h4>
<p>Credential Stuffing and Spraying attacks have been used to compromise household names the world over with Account Takeover attacks. Attackers use bots and breached credential lists to perform low and slow brute force attacks and takeover user accounts. Barracuda ABP hosts a cloud database of breached credentials and validated incoming logins against this database. When a hit is found, you can then block the attacker and secure the user account.</p>

<h4>Machine Learnign Based Bot Detection</h4>
<p>Today’s bots are built to be almost human in their behavior. Standard signature checks and validations do not always catch these bots. Barracuda ABP’s cloud-based detection identifies the most advanced bots within the first few requests using a combination of website specific rules and machine learning models. The website specific rules are built by our system for each application you onboard, leading to a very low false positive rate. Since the ML system is built in the cloud, new bot detection models that are deployed are usable by all connected systems without needing a firmware upgrade.</p>

<h4>Crowd-Sourced Bot Detection</h4>
<p>The Barracuda ABP systems gets data from a massive honeypot network which collects many forms of threat intelligence beyond web attacks. This intelligence is combined with other data we see in production systems the world over, and a curated crowd-sourced threat intelligence stream is available to every ABP customer.</p>","<ul style=""list-style-type:disc"">

When a hit is found, you can then block the attacker and secure the user account.</p>

<h4>Machine Learnign Based Bot Detection</h4>
<p>Today’s bots are built to be almost human in their behavior. Standard signature checks and validations do not always catch these bots. Barracuda ABP’s cloud-based detection identifies the most advanced bots within the first few requests using a combination of website specific rules and machine learning models. The website specific rules are built by our system for each application you onboard, leading to a very low false positive rate. Since the ML system is built in the cloud, new bot detection models that are deployed are usable by all connected systems without needing a firmware upgrade.</p>

<h4>Crowd-Sourced Bot Detection</h4>
<p>The Barracuda ABP systems gets data from a massive honeypot network which collects many forms of threat intelligence beyond web attacks. This intelligence is combined with other data we see in production systems the world over, and a curated crowd-sourced threat intelligence stream is available to every ABP customer.</p>","<ul style=""list-style-type:disc"">

<h2>Features</h2>
<h4>Web & Price Scraping Protection</h4>
Competitors and other third parties often use automated scripts to steal pricing and other content in real-time. Price scraping and content scraping results in reduced customer visits and conversions. The ABP solution uses a number of signals – page access speeds, page access patterns, client telemetry (IP, SSL Fingerprint) etc – to identify and block possible web scraping attempts.

<h4>Brute Force Detection</h4>
<p>Brute Force attacks are typically used during reconnaissance attempts – these include attacks like directory traversal, credential cracking etc. The Barracuda WAF product line can identify brute force attempts from individual clients and block them.</p>


<h4>Bot Spam Detection</h4>
<p>Bot Spam takes various forms – it can be in the form of referrer spam, polluting your website analytics. Alternatively, it can present as Form Spam, with thousands of spurious signups on your internet facing forms. Either way, you end up with skewed data that can take forever to clean up. Barracuda ABP uses several methods to identify and block such spam, including learning all the forms on a website and the time taken to fill the form. It then uses these learned parameters to identify spammers and block them.</p>


<h4>Client Fingerprinting</h4>
<p>Blocking an entire IP address for bad behavior causes significant problems. This method can be used for known problem IP ranges, such as hosting providers, TOR ranges etc, but in most cases, an IP address may have hundreds or more users behind it. The Barracuda ABP systems uses passive and active methods to fingerprint each client beyond the IP, down to the browser level. This allows you to block a single misbehaving client down to the browser level, reducing the blast radius of the block.</p>
<h4>Protective Defence</h4>
<p>Bots come from a variety of sources – home IP addresses, datacenters, VPS, consumer VPN providers and Tor. In some cases, it is quite easy to stop bots by blocking entire IP ranges, like VPS providers or datacenters. The Barracuda WAF product line provides several such IP categories, including reputation-based lists to proactively block attackers and bots at the IP level.</p>

<h4>Account Takeover Detection</h4>
<p>Credential Stuffing and Spraying attacks have been used to compromise household names the world over with Account Takeover attacks. Attackers use bots and breached credential lists to perform low and slow brute force attacks and takeover user accounts. Barracuda ABP hosts a cloud database of breached credentials and validated incoming logins against this database. When a hit is found, you can then block the attacker and secure the user account.</p>

Barracuda ABP uses several methods to identify and block such spam, including learning all the forms on a website and the time taken to fill the form. It then uses these learned parameters to identify spammers and block them.</p>


<h4>Client Fingerprinting</h4>
<p>Blocking an entire IP address for bad behavior causes significant problems. This method can be used for known problem IP ranges, such as hosting providers, TOR ranges etc, but in most cases, an IP address may have hundreds or more users behind it. The Barracuda ABP systems uses passive and active methods to fingerprint each client beyond the IP, down to the browser level. This allows you to block a single misbehaving client down to the browser level, reducing the blast radius of the block.</p>
<h4>Protective Defence</h4>
<p>Bots come from a variety of sources – home IP addresses, datacenters, VPS, consumer VPN providers and Tor. In some cases, it is quite easy to stop bots by blocking entire IP ranges, like VPS providers or datacenters. The Barracuda WAF product line provides several such IP categories, including reputation-based lists to proactively block attackers and bots at the IP level.</p>

<h4>Account Takeover Detection</h4>
<p>Credential Stuffing and Spraying attacks have been used to compromise household names the world over with Account Takeover attacks. Attackers use bots and breached credential lists to perform low and slow brute force attacks and takeover user accounts. Barracuda ABP hosts a cloud database of breached credentials and validated incoming logins against this database. When a hit is found, you can then block the attacker and secure the user account.</p>

<h4>Machine Learnign Based Bot Detection</h4>
<p>Today’s bots are built to be almost human in their behavior. Standard signature checks and validations do not always catch these bots. Barracuda ABP’s cloud-based detection identifies the most advanced bots within the first few requests using a combination of website specific rules and machine learning models. The website specific rules are built by our system for each application you onboard, leading to a very low false positive rate. Since the ML system is built in the cloud, new bot detection models that are deployed are usable by all connected systems without needing a firmware upgrade.</p>

<h4>Crowd-Sourced Bot Detection</h4>
<p>The Barracuda ABP systems gets data from a massive honeypot network which collects many forms of threat intelligence beyond web attacks. This intelligence is combined with other data we see in production systems the world over, and a curated crowd-sourced threat intelligence stream is available to every ABP customer.</p>","<ul style=""list-style-type:disc"">

<h2>Features</h2>
<h4>Web & Price Scraping Protection</h4>
Competitors and other third parties often use automated scripts to steal pricing and other content in real-time. Price scraping and content scraping results in reduced customer visits and conversions. The ABP solution uses a number of signals – page access speeds, page access patterns, client telemetry (IP, SSL Fingerprint) etc – to identify and block possible web scraping attempts.

<h4>Brute Force Detection</h4>
<p>Brute Force attacks are typically used during reconnaissance attempts – these include attacks like directory traversal, credential cracking etc. The Barracuda WAF product line can identify brute force attempts from individual clients and block them.</p>


<h4>Bot Spam Detection</h4>
<p>Bot Spam takes various forms – it can be in the form of referrer spam, polluting your website analytics. Alternatively, it can present as Form Spam, with thousands of spurious signups on your internet facing forms. Either way, you end up with skewed data that can take forever to clean up. Barracuda ABP uses several methods to identify and block such spam, including learning all the forms on a website and the time taken to fill the form. It then uses these learned parameters to identify spammers and block them.</p>


<h4>Client Fingerprinting</h4>
<p>Blocking an entire IP address for bad behavior causes significant problems. This method can be used for known problem IP ranges, such as hosting providers, TOR ranges etc, but in most cases, an IP address may have hundreds or more users behind it. The Barracuda ABP systems uses passive and active methods to fingerprint each client beyond the IP, down to the browser level. This allows you to block a single misbehaving client down to the browser level, reducing the blast radius of the block.</p>
<h4>Protective Defence</h4>
<p>Bots come from a variety of sources – home IP addresses, datacenters, VPS, consumer VPN providers and Tor. In some cases, it is quite easy to stop bots by blocking entire IP ranges, like VPS providers or datacenters. The Barracuda WAF product line provides several such IP categories, including reputation-based lists to proactively block attackers and bots at the IP level.</p>

<h4>Account Takeover Detection</h4>
<p>Credential Stuffing and Spraying attacks have been used to compromise household names the world over with Account Takeover attacks. Attackers use bots and breached credential lists to perform low and slow brute force attacks and takeover user accounts. Barracuda ABP hosts a cloud database of breached credentials and validated incoming logins against this database. When a hit is found, you can then block the attacker and secure the user account.</p>

<h4>Machine Learnign Based Bot Detection</h4>
<p>Today’s bots are built to be almost human in their behavior. Standard signature checks and validations do not always catch these bots. Barracuda ABP’s cloud-based detection identifies the most advanced bots within the first few requests using a combination of website specific rules and machine learning models. The website specific rules are built by our system for each application you onboard, leading to a very low false positive rate. Since the ML system is built in the cloud, new bot detection models that are deployed are usable by all connected systems without needing a firmware upgrade.</p>

<h4>Crowd-Sourced Bot Detection</h4>
<p>The Barracuda ABP systems gets data from a massive honeypot network which collects many forms of threat intelligence beyond web attacks. This intelligence is combined with other data we see in production systems the world over, and a curated crowd-sourced threat intelligence stream is available to every ABP customer.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<h4>Web & Price Scraping Protection</h4>
Competitors and other third parties often use automated scripts to steal pricing and other content in real-time. Price scraping and content scraping results in reduced customer visits and conversions. The ABP solution uses a number of signals – page access speeds, page access patterns, client telemetry (IP, SSL Fingerprint) etc – to identify and block possible web scraping attempts.

<h4>Brute Force Detection</h4>
<p>Brute Force attacks are typically used during reconnaissance attempts – these include attacks like directory traversal, credential cracking etc. The Barracuda WAF product line can identify brute force attempts from individual clients and block them.</p>


<h4>Bot Spam Detection</h4>
<p>Bot Spam takes various forms – it can be in the form of referrer spam, polluting your website analytics. Alternatively, it can present as Form Spam, with thousands of spurious signups on your internet facing forms. Either way, you end up with skewed data that can take forever to clean up. Barracuda ABP uses several methods to identify and block such spam, including learning all the forms on a website and the time taken to fill the form. It then uses these learned parameters to identify spammers and block them.</p>


<h4>Client Fingerprinting</h4>
<p>Blocking an entire IP address for bad behavior causes significant problems. This method can be used for known problem IP ranges, such as hosting providers, TOR ranges etc, but in most cases, an IP address may have hundreds or more users behind it. The Barracuda ABP systems uses passive and active methods to fingerprint each client beyond the IP, down to the browser level. This allows you to block a single misbehaving client down to the browser level, reducing the blast radius of the block.</p>
<h4>Protective Defence</h4>
<p>Bots come from a variety of sources – home IP addresses, datacenters, VPS, consumer VPN providers and Tor. In some cases, it is quite easy to stop bots by blocking entire IP ranges, like VPS providers or datacenters. The Barracuda WAF product line provides several such IP categories, including reputation-based lists to proactively block attackers and bots at the IP level.</p>

<h4>Account Takeover Detection</h4>
<p>Credential Stuffing and Spraying attacks have been used to compromise household names the world over with Account Takeover attacks. Attackers use bots and breached credential lists to perform low and slow brute force attacks and takeover user accounts. Barracuda ABP hosts a cloud database of breached credentials and validated incoming logins against this database. When a hit is found, you can then block the attacker and secure the user account.</p>

<h4>Machine Learnign Based Bot Detection</h4>
<p>Today’s bots are built to be almost human in their behavior. Standard signature checks and validations do not always catch these bots. Barracuda ABP’s cloud-based detection identifies the most advanced bots within the first few requests using a combination of website specific rules and machine learning models. The website specific rules are built by our system for each application you onboard, leading to a very low false positive rate. Since the ML system is built in the cloud, new bot detection models that are deployed are usable by all connected systems without needing a firmware upgrade.</p>

<h4>Crowd-Sourced Bot Detection</h4>
<p>The Barracuda ABP systems gets data from a massive honeypot network which collects many forms of threat intelligence beyond web attacks. This intelligence is combined with other data we see in production systems the world over, and a curated crowd-sourced threat intelligence stream is available to every ABP customer.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<h4>Web & Price Scraping Protection</h4>
Competitors and other third parties often use automated scripts to steal pricing and other content in real-time. Price scraping and content scraping results in reduced customer visits and conversions. The ABP solution uses a number of signals – page access speeds, page access patterns, client telemetry (IP, SSL Fingerprint) etc – to identify and block possible web scraping attempts.

<h4>Brute Force Detection</h4>
<p>Brute Force attacks are typically used during reconnaissance attempts – these include attacks like directory traversal, credential cracking etc. The Barracuda WAF product line can identify brute force attempts from individual clients and block them.</p>


<h4>Bot Spam Detection</h4>
<p>Bot Spam takes various forms – it can be in the form of referrer spam, polluting your website analytics. Alternatively, it can present as Form Spam, with thousands of spurious signups on your internet facing forms. Either way, you end up with skewed data that can take forever to clean up. Barracuda ABP uses several methods to identify and block such spam, including learning all the forms on a website and the time taken to fill the form. It then uses these learned parameters to identify spammers and block them.</p>


<h4>Client Fingerprinting</h4>
<p>Blocking an entire IP address for bad behavior causes significant problems. This method can be used for known problem IP ranges, such as hosting providers, TOR ranges etc, but in most cases, an IP address may have hundreds or more users behind it. The Barracuda ABP systems uses passive and active methods to fingerprint each client beyond the IP, down to the browser level. This allows you to block a single misbehaving client down to the browser level, reducing the blast radius of the block.</p>
<h4>Protective Defence</h4>
<p>Bots come from a variety of sources – home IP addresses, datacenters, VPS, consumer VPN providers and Tor. In some cases, it is quite easy to stop bots by blocking entire IP ranges, like VPS providers or datacenters. The Barracuda WAF product line provides several such IP categories, including reputation-based lists to proactively block attackers and bots at the IP level.</p>

<h4>Account Takeover Detection</h4>
<p>Credential Stuffing and Spraying attacks have been used to compromise household names the world over with Account Takeover attacks. Attackers use bots and breached credential lists to perform low and slow brute force attacks and takeover user accounts. Barracuda ABP hosts a cloud database of breached credentials and validated incoming logins against this database. When a hit is found, you can then block the attacker and secure the user account.</p>

<h4>Machine Learnign Based Bot Detection</h4>
<p>Today’s bots are built to be almost human in their behavior. Standard signature checks and validations do not always catch these bots. Barracuda ABP’s cloud-based detection identifies the most advanced bots within the first few requests using a combination of website specific rules and machine learning models. The website specific rules are built by our system for each application you onboard, leading to a very low false positive rate. Since the ML system is built in the cloud, new bot detection models that are deployed are usable by all connected systems without needing a firmware upgrade.</p>

<h4>Crowd-Sourced Bot Detection</h4>
<p>The Barracuda ABP systems gets data from a massive honeypot network which collects many forms of threat intelligence beyond web attacks. This intelligence is combined with other data we see in production systems the world over, and a curated crowd-sourced threat intelligence stream is available to every ABP customer.</p>

<p>With a Barracuda Backup AWS Replication subscription, Barracuda Backup can replicate data securely and efficiently from an on-premises physical or virtual Barracuda Backup appliance to the AWS public cloud. This adds more deployment options and flexibility for customers replicating data as can choose to replicate to the Barracuda Cloud, a remote physical appliance, a remote virtual appliance, or the AWS public cloud target.</p>

<p>Note that you are sending data to your own AWS account, therefore you must have both an AWS Replication subscription and an AWS account to replicate data.</p>

<p>Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of secure compute, storage, application, and deployment services that help organizations to move faster, scale applications, and lower IT costs. However, since you are still responsible for protecting your own AWS-based assets you need security that can complement the AWS shared security model. That’s where Barracuda can help.</p>

<p>In the cloud, companies still need to protect their business resources, also known as network threat vectors—company email, web applications, network perimeter, remote access, mobility, and users. While threat vectors remain constant, attack surfaces are always changing; these include physical, virtual, and cloud. What’s required is powerful security for applications, network, web, and email. Barracuda understands your IT needs and provides best-of-breed solutions for firewalling, load balancing, web application security, and email security on Amazon Web Services.</p>

<p>The Barracuda Web Application Firewall for AWS is a scalable security solution that protects applications from targeted and automated attacks. Customers are able to:</p>

<ul style='list-style-type:disc'> 
<li>Protect web applications from data breaches, defacement, OWASP Top-10 Attacks, application layer DDoS and other attack vectors</li>

<p>Note that you are sending data to your own AWS account, therefore you must have both an AWS Replication subscription and an AWS account to replicate data.</p>

<p>Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of secure compute, storage, application, and deployment services that help organizations to move faster, scale applications, and lower IT costs. However, since you are still responsible for protecting your own AWS-based assets you need security that can complement the AWS shared security model. That’s where Barracuda can help.</p>

<p>In the cloud, companies still need to protect their business resources, also known as network threat vectors—company email, web applications, network perimeter, remote access, mobility, and users. While threat vectors remain constant, attack surfaces are always changing; these include physical, virtual, and cloud. What’s required is powerful security for applications, network, web, and email. Barracuda understands your IT needs and provides best-of-breed solutions for firewalling, load balancing, web application security, and email security on Amazon Web Services.</p>

<p>With a Barracuda Backup AWS Replication subscription, Barracuda Backup can replicate data securely and efficiently from an on-premises physical or virtual Barracuda Backup appliance to the AWS public cloud. This adds more deployment options and flexibility for customers replicating data as can choose to replicate to the Barracuda Cloud, a remote physical appliance, a remote virtual appliance, or the AWS public cloud target.</p>

<p>Note that you are sending data to your own AWS account, therefore you must have both an AWS Replication subscription and an AWS account to replicate data.</p>

<p>Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of secure compute, storage, application, and deployment services that help organizations to move faster, scale applications, and lower IT costs. However, since you are still responsible for protecting your own AWS-based assets you need security that can complement the AWS shared security model. That’s where Barracuda can help.</p>

<p>In the cloud, companies still need to protect their business resources, also known as network threat vectors—company email, web applications, network perimeter, remote access, mobility, and users. While threat vectors remain constant, attack surfaces are always changing; these include physical, virtual, and cloud. What’s required is powerful security for applications, network, web, and email.

<h2>Features:</h2>
        <h3>Connectivity and SD-WAN</h3>
        <p><strong>Global secure SD-WAN service</strong></p>
        <p>CloudGen WAN brings full SD-WAN functionality to Azure Virtual WAN, Microsoft’s native hybrid cloud service. Secure SD-WAN dynamically selects the most suitable uplink for each application in real time, based on traffic characteristics, available bandwidth, and latency between VPN endpoints. This lets you replace MPLS lines by globally connecting your sites via the Microsoft Global Network, the world’s fasted private network. Purpose-built for the cloud, CloudGen WAN provides seamless, automated access to your business-critical resourses, leveraging a rich feature-set including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Adaptive bandwidth protection</li>
          <li>Adaptive session balancing</li>
          <li>Forward error correction (FEC)</li>
          <li>SD-WAN breakout</li>
          <li>Dynamic bandwidth and latency detection</li>
          <li>Performance-based transport selection</li>
          <li>TINA—Barracuda’s proprietary VPN protocol</li>
          <li>Site-to-site connectivity</li>
          <li>Failover link support</li>
          <li>Dynamic quality of service</li>
          <li>WAN compression</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Azure Virtual WAN</strong></p>
        <p>Directly deployed from Azure marketplace, the CloudGen WAN gateway becomes a part of Microsoft’s Azure Virtual Hub and, together with CloudGen WAN site devices, ensures optimized connectivity from every branch office to the nearest Azure Cloud entry point. Barracuda supports dynamic path selection across multiple ISPs for Azure Virtual WAN, giving you failsafe, always-on cloud connectivity. The close integration with native Azure services seamlessly integrates Barracuda CloudGen WAN into your Azure cloud infrastructure.        </p>
        <h3>Management and Automation</h3>
        <p><strong>Simple to deploy</strong></p>
        <p>CloudGen WAN is easy to set up and does not require specialized IT skills. Directly deployed from Azure marketplace, the service works out of the box with smart default configuration, suitable for all cloud and SaaS applications. CloudGen WAN runs natively as a SaaS service inside one or multiple Azure Virtual WAN regions and provides easy, automated access to the Microsoft Global Network. The service can either be rolled out to all locations as a pure SD-WAN solution alongside existing firewalls or as a secure SD-WAN solution replacing existing firewalls.</p>
        <p><strong>Zero-touch site deployment</strong></p>
        <p>Zero-touch deployment lets you deploy CloudGen WAN site devices directly from the factory to the desired remote location without requiring on-site IT personnel. Simply connect the unit and power it up. With no need for manual configuration on-site, zero-touch deployment allows you to deploy CloudGen WAN site devices across widely distributed organizations easily, rapidly, and at very low cost.</p>
        <p><strong>Simple to operate</strong></p>
        <p>Directly managed via the CloudGen WAN management portal for all regions and all sites across your global WAN, regardless of the number of cloud entry points or locations. The central cloud portal offers the highest degree of automation and unparalleled ease of use. CloudGen WAN continuously monitors and optimizes network performance to ensure uninterrupted always-on connectivity and high quality of service levels for your business-critical traffic and applications.</p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p><strong>Advanced multi-layered security</strong></p>
        <p>CloudGen WAN is built on the same technology as CloudGen Firewall, Barracuda’s battle-tested enterprise firewall (“Recommended” in NSS Labs NGFW Group Test 2019). Purpose-built for the cloud, CloudGen WAN provides advanced multi-layered security to protect your business-critical resourses, leveraging a rich feature-set including:</p>

<p>Barracuda combines a global threat intelligence database and artificial intelligence to stop email threats that others can&rsquo;t. It collects email, network, and application threat data from over 200,000 companies worldwide.

<p>With a Barracuda Backup AWS Replication subscription, Barracuda Backup can replicate data securely and efficiently from an on-premises physical or virtual Barracuda Backup appliance to the AWS public cloud. This adds more deployment options and flexibility for customers replicating data as can choose to replicate to the Barracuda Cloud, a remote physical appliance, a remote virtual appliance, or the AWS public cloud target.</p>

<p>Note that you are sending data to your own AWS account, therefore you must have both an AWS Replication subscription and an AWS account to replicate data.</p>

<p>Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of secure compute, storage, application, and deployment services that help organizations to move faster, scale applications, and lower IT costs. However, since you are still responsible for protecting your own AWS-based assets you need security that can complement the AWS shared security model. That’s where Barracuda can help.</p>

<p>In the cloud, companies still need to protect their business resources, also known as network threat vectors—company email, web applications, network perimeter, remote access, mobility, and users. While threat vectors remain constant, attack surfaces are always changing; these include physical, virtual, and cloud. What’s required is powerful security for applications, network, web, and email. Barracuda understands your IT needs and provides best-of-breed solutions for firewalling, load balancing, web application security, and email security on Amazon Web Services.</p>

<p>The Barracuda Web Application Firewall for AWS is a scalable security solution that protects applications from targeted and automated attacks. Customers are able to:</p>

<ul style='list-style-type:disc'> 
<li>Protect web applications from data breaches, defacement, OWASP Top-10 Attacks, application layer DDoS and other attack vectors</li>
<li>Receive automatic updates with defense against new threats and vulnerabilities with real-time protection</li>
<li>Use strong authentication and access control capabilities to ensure security and privacy – restrict access to sensitive applications or data</li>
<li>Ability to bootstrap and auto scale as required with automated and clustered deployments using CloudFormation templates.</li>
<li>Available on the AWS marketplace as a single AMI or as a CloudFormation Template via the AWS Marketplace support for Clusters and AWS Resources</li>

<p>Barracuda’s simplified IT model gives your organization an easy to use and affordable security solution. Companies of all sizes can enjoy total application security without learning, configuring, or managing complex technology.</p></div>","<ul style='list-style-type:disc'>
